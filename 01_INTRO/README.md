**Introduction**

ROSRider is a versatile electronics card that empowers you to create custom ROS-compatible robots. ROSRider can control and power a range of small encoder gear motors, enabling the construction of 2-wheeled or 4-wheeled robots of small to medium size. By cascading multiple ROSRider cards, you can expand the robot's capabilities to support higher wheel counts and more complex configurations.

Below is an image of a minimal chassis designed for lane-following tasks using image processing. This compact setup incorporates two encoder gear motors, a Raspberry Pi 4 computer, and a ROSRider card, all seamlessly integrated into a minimal footprint. This streamlined platform empowers developers to quickly prototype and experiment with autonomous vehicle concepts, making it an ideal tool for learning and innovation in robotics.

This image showcases a more advanced robotic platform designed for research and development. The integration of a ROSRider card and a ROS2RPI card with a Raspberry Pi enables the robot to execute a wide range of ROS programs and packages. The addition of a LiDAR sensor further empowers the robot with advanced capabilities such as SLAM, mapping, autonomous navigation, and autonomous exploration. This versatile platform provides a solid foundation for exploring various robotics applications and research projects.

The ROSRider and ROS2RPI cards significantly simplify the user experience by automating tasks like battery management and device power cycling. This eliminates the need for manual intervention, such as disconnecting batteries or manually powering on devices. Additionally, the cards can automatically put the system into a low-power hibernation mode when idle, conserving battery life.

The ROS2RPI card offers flexible serial port routing, enabling remote access to the Raspberry Pi and other devices like LiDAR sensors. This feature prevents boot conflicts caused by LiDAR serial output during system startup and allows for remote control of the LiDAR, extending its operational life and simplifying maintenance procedures.
