**Introduction**

ROSRider is a versatile electronics card that empowers you to create custom ROS-compatible robots. It can drive a variety of small encoder gear motors, allowing building of 2 wheeled or 4 wheeled small to medium sized robots.

**Supported Platforms**


**Advanced**

- Publishes diagnostic packages, that contain battery voltage, consumed current, motor left current feedback, motor right current feedback, and status messages generated by board
- Under-voltage, Over-voltage, Over-current, Motor over-current limits can be configured
