__Procedures__

We will demonstrate how to optimize the robot's control system by adjusting PID parameters.

- [PID Tuning](01_PID/README.md)

We will show how to remotely control the robot using a joystick or keyboard.

- [Robot Teleoperation](02_TELEOP/README.md)

We will verify the accuracy of the robot's self-localization system by comparing it to ground truth observations.

- [Odometry Validation](03_ODOMETRY/README.md)

We will explore various tools and techniques to monitor the robot's health and performance.

- [Diagnostics](04_DIAGNOSTICS/README.md)

 We will discuss the importance of precise timing and control in robotic systems and how to achieve it.

- [Timing-Control](05_TIMING/README.md)

You can now proceed to the next chapter, where we'll delve into simulations and virtual environments to test and refine your robotic applications.
