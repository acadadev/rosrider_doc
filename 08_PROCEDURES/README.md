    </div>
</div>

We will show how to remotely control the robot using a joystick or keyboard.

- [Robot Teleoperation](02_TELEOP/README.md)

We will verify the accuracy of the robot's self-localization system by comparing it to ground truth observations.

- [Odometry Validation](03_ODOMETRY/README.md)

We will explore various tools and techniques to monitor the robot's health and performance.

- [Diagnostics](04_DIAGNOSTICS/README.md)

 We will discuss the importance of precise timing and control in robotic systems and how to achieve it.

- [Timing Control](05_TIMING/README.md)

 We will discuss the importance of precise timing and control in robotic systems and how to achieve it.

- [Servo Control](06_SERVO/README.md)
