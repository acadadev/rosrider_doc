__Procedures__

[TODO: make movies with the following subjects]

1. PID tuning
2. Odometry Validation
3. How to teleop
4. Diagnostics health check
6. demonstration of timing-control with rqt_plot and all

You can now proceed to the next chapter, where we'll delve into simulations and virtual environments to test and refine your robotic applications.
