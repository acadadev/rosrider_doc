# What is the ROSRider?

ROSRider is an electronics hardware product that allows the control of any differential drive robot using Robot Operating System. 
ROSRider aims to lower the cost barrier for building ROS based robots. Using commodity parts, users can build robots that can run the Robot Operating System.

- Any encoder gear motor can be used as a servo motor. Parameters such as reduction ratio, wheel diameter, encoder ppr are configurable with yaml files
- Publishes diagnostic packages, that contain battery voltage, consumed current, motor left current feedback, motor right current feedback, and status messages generated by board
- Under-voltage, Over-voltage, Over-current, Motor over-current limits can be configured
